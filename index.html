        <h1>Conference Article: Is the Decentralisation of Web 3.0 Achievable in its Current State?</h1>

        <section id="section1">
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Web 3.0 was developed as a decentralised web network and guarantees the decentralisation of user data and the clearing of power structures inherent in Web 2.0 (Alabdulwahhab, 2018). This article evaluates the degree of realisable decentralisation within the blockchain-based Web 3.0 platform, as it explores its usability, regulated token operations, congestion, and environmental and compliance-related issues (Reiff, 2024; Earthjustice, 2022). There is promise of a user-friendly internet, but technical and operational problems still need to improve the full adoption of Web 3.0. The article delineates the advancement and the restrictions in the actualisation of decentralisation, thus, concluding that the substantial gains in technology, regulation, and users' adoption of the technology are prerequisites for the Web 3.0 vision to come to fruition, and as a result, technology, law, and user participation must impute.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The internet’s evolution has drastically changed how humans interact with each other and the world around us. With this, society has shifted, becoming more data-driven as our data is ever more valuable and out of our control (Swan, 2015). Web 3.0 now introduces decentralisation as its defining feature. Coined by Gavin Wood in 2014, Web 3.0 envisions a “trustless” Internet where users control their data without central oversight (Alabdulwahhab, 2018). However, in a world dominated by major corporations such as Meta and Google, this article questions the feasibility of Web 3.0’s decentralisation in its current form (Kim, 2019). Through an exploration of blockchain technology, token economics, and systemic challenges, the article aims to determine if Web 3.0 can indeed achieve decentralisation or if it remains an idealistic vision (Swan, 2015).</p>

        <section id="section3">
            <h2>The Evolution of the Web</h2>
            <p>Understanding Web 3.0’s decentralisation aims requires examining previous web incarnations and their effects on data control.</p>
            
            <h3>Web 1.0</h3>
            <p>Web 1.0 was the first stage of the Internet. It was mainly “read-only,” featuring static pages with limited user interaction. Built on basic technologies like HTML and HTTP, Web 1.0 established core protocols for data retrieval and information sharing without centralised data management (Geroni, 2021).</p>
            
            <h3>Web 2.0</h3>
            <p>Web 2.0 transformed the internet by enabling user interaction, content creation, and social media growth. Platforms like Facebook and YouTube allow companies to collect and monetise large amounts of user data (Reiff, 2024). Companies such as Meta and Amazon now control much of the infrastructure behind Web 2.0, making today’s internet highly centralised (Swan, 2015).</p>
        </section>
      

        <section id="section4">
            <h2>The Promise of Web 3.0 Decentralisation</h2>
            <p>By utilising blockchain technology and decentralised protocols, Web 3.0 seeks to remove centralised power structures that are used in Web 2.0. The main goal is to allow users to transact directly without middlemen, returning control of data to the users (Alabdulwahhab, 2018). Essential Web 3.0 innovations such as peer-to-peer transactions and decentralised applications (DApps) aim to replace central servers with a network of computers managed by the users themselves (Marlinspike, 2022).</p>
        </section>

        <section id="section5">
            <h2>Blockchain as the Backbone of Decentralisation</h2>
            <p>Blockchain is the backbone of decentralisation. In order to achieve decentralisation, a technological framework is needed to prevent data from being stored in a central server, hence centralisation (Kim, 2019). The blockchain operates by redistributing data to a number of nodes instead of saving it on a particular server. Each transaction is recorded in the ledger, which is a common property, and DApps might use it to give their users possession or control over their data (Geroni, 2021).</p>
        </section>

        <section id="section6">
            <h2>Token Economy and Incentivisation</h2>
            <p>Token economies introduce financial incentives that back up protocol development, draw investment, and empower developers to create decentralised apps on platforms like Ethereum (Swan, 2015). This model has high potential, but still, it copes with the adoption issues. The low appeal for a massively new audience is because of its intricacy and speculative nature (Swan, 2015).</p>
        </section>

         <section id="section7">
            <h2>Challenges to Decentralisation in Web 3.0</h2>
            <p>Although blockchain has great potential, several challenges make it hard to achieve a fully decentralised Web 3.0:</p>
             
            <h3>Blockchain Scalability</h3>
            <p>Scalability is a major issue. Validating transactions on blockchain networks takes a lot of resources and is slower than centralised systems. For example, Bitcoin can process only about seven transactions per second, while Visa can handle up to 24,000 (Geroni, 2021). This difference limits Web 3.0’s ability to compete with Web 2.0 effectively (Swan, 2015).</p>
             
            <h3>Environmental Impact</h3>
            <p>The energy use of proof-of-work algorithms raises environmental concerns. For instance, Bitcoin mining consumes more energy than some countries (Reiff, 2024). This high energy consumption goes against the goal of creating a sustainable, user-controlled internet (Earthjustice, 2022).</p>
             
            <h3>Lack of Standardisation</h3>
            <p>The lack of standard protocols across blockchain networks is another challenge. Different types of networks use different consensus mechanisms such as proof-of-work and proof-of-stake (Swan, 2015). This leads to confusion among users and developers, thus decelerating the development of a viable and uniform decentralised ecosystem (Reiff, 2024).</p>
             
            <h3>Security and Privacy</h3>
            <p>Decentralised systems can also enable organisations to implement data-driven solutions and other security measures to protect privacy and confidentiality (Hedera, n.d.). The risk factors they face include, for example, a “51% attack,” where malicious entities may overtake the network (Nevil, 2024). In addition, the public nature of blockchain data makes it impossible to keep sensitive information secure, which may stop people from adopting such systems (IBM, n.d.).</p>
        </section>

        <section id="section8">
            <h2>Centralised Elements within Decentralised Frameworks</h2>
            <p>Even though we might think of Web 3.0 as being decentralised, it is not yet the case. Even though most apps claim decentralisation, they still operate with servers provided by central entities that perform essential functions (Swan, 2015). Infura and Alchemy, which act as central nodes in Ethereum, provide their APIs to DApps and hence the network can be called distributed but actually, it is centralised (Marlinspike, 2022). Such transformation demonstrates how difficult it is to remove centralised structures (Geroni, 2021). Further, while Binance handles the lion's share of cryptocurrency trading, OpenSea is the leader in the NFT market. Tether is the biggest stablecoin in existence, as per its offering, thus making the system a centralised one (Swan, 2015). Concerns have been raised over the possibility of a genuinely decentralised internet in which users get to control their data in the future in light of these factors (Alabdulwahhab, 2018). If these limitations are not removed, the times of Web 3.0 might resemble the centralisation period of Web 2.0.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="section9">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In summary, the decentralisation of Web 3.0 is achievable, but only if these technical and regulatory hurdles are overcome. While the cutting-edge technology of Web 3.0 clinches a decentralised web where individuals are in control over their data, issues of technical feasibility and the environment and regulatory bodies will have to be addressed for the vision to be a real possibility (Geroni, 2021). Genuine decentralisation depends not only on technological progress but also on the movement of users, regulatory gears, and incentive schemes proposed in the adoption of distributed networks compared to centralised ones (Swan, 2015). Otherwise, Web 3.0 is an incredible aim rather than a functional truth (Swan, 2015).</p>
